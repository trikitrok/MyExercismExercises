;; The BankAccount module should support four calls:
;;
;; open-account
;; Called at the start of each test. Returns a BankAccount.
;;
;; close-account account
;; Called at the end of each test.
;;
;; balance account
;; Get the balance of the bank account.
;;
;; update-balance account amount
;; Increment the balance of the bank account by the given amount.
;; The amount may be negative for a withdrawal.
;;
;; The initial balance of the bank account should be 0.
